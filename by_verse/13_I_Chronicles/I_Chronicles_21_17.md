# I Chronicles 21:17

And David said to God, Was it not I who gave command to number the people? It is I who have sinned and done great evil. But these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O Lord my God, be against me and against my fatherâ€™s house. But do not let the plague be on your people.

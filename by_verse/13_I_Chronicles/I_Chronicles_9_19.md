# I Chronicles 9:19

Shallum the son of Kore, son of Ebiasaph, son of Korah, and his kinsmen of his fathers ’ house, the Korahites, were in charge of the work of the service, keepers of the thresholds of the tent, as their fathers had been in charge of the camp of the Lord, keepers of the entrance.

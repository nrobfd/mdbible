# II Samuel 24:16

And when the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the Lord relented from the calamity and said to the angel who was working destruction among the people, It is enough; now stay your hand. And the angel of the Lord was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.

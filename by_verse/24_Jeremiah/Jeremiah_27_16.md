# Jeremiah 27:16

Then I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus says the Lord : Do not listen to the words of your prophets who are prophesying to you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the Lord â€™s house will now shortly be brought back from Babylon, for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you.

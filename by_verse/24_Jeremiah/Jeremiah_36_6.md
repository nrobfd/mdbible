# Jeremiah 36:6

so you are to go, and on a day of fasting in the hearing of all the people in the Lord â€™s house you shall read the words of the Lord from the scroll that you have written at my dictation. You shall read them also in the hearing of all the men of Judah who come out of their cities.

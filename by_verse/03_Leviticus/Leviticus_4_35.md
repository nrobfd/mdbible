# Leviticus 4:35

And all its fat he shall remove as the fat of the lamb is removed from the sacrifice of peace offerings, and the priest shall burn it on the altar, on top of the Lord ’s food offerings. And the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin which he has committed, and he shall be forgiven.

# Joshua 22:19

But now, if the land of your possession is unclean, pass over into the Lord ’s land where the Lord ’s tabernacle stands, and take for yourselves a possession among us. Only do not rebel against the Lord or make us as rebels by building for yourselves an altar other than the altar of the Lord our God.

# Ezekiel 46:9

When the people of the land come before the Lord at the appointed feasts, he who enters by the north gate to worship shall go out by the south gate, and he who enters by the south gate shall go out by the north gate : no one shall return by way of the gate by which he entered, but each shall go out straight ahead.

# Ezekiel 20:47

Say to the forest of the Negeb, Hear the word of the Lord : Thus says the Lord God, Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you and every dry tree. The blazing flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from south to north shall be scorched by it.
